Hello, this is the read-me file about my Mobile App Design and Development.

My app is called 'HarvestHome 'The app is for helping people to start to plant there own food especially fruit and veg. I  beleive that if people start to grow there own foods there will be less waste and prices will start to fall. 

The app has 3 pages in which the first 2 have vegetables and fruits which are easy to plant. i have made these 2 pages easy to use and understand as they have images that are easy to view and unerstand which vegetable and fruit is which, as well as a small information off how to get started from the https://www.rhs.org.uk page. i have also added a button on both of these pages which can take you to a creat source to help any new gardernes or are interested in more fruits or vegetbales.

the 3rd page i have used an api to create a weather page for where ever you are. I believe a weather page in my app is very helpful as it can help to tell you if your going to need to water your plants due to the high temptures or leave them etc. also gives you data about current temperature, wind speed which is especially needed for planting new foods.
